```bash
# install the dependencies via npm
npm install

# start the server in dev mode with HMR
npm run start
```
go to [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) in your browser. Done.

### npm scripts

* `npm run start` - runs the compiler and a server at the same time in dev mode with HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
* `npm run build` - runs the compiler once and generates a production build.
* `npm run build_serve` - it makes a build and serves it to port 8080.
